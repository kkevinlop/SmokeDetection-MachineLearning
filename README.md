# SmokeDetection-MachineLearning

Smoke detection plays a crucial role in ensuring early fire detection and prevention, reducing potential risks to life. Fire affects humans’ health due to the toxicity of its components, such as humidity, temperature, and chemical substances. Thus, the elderly, children, pregnant women, people with respiratory or cardiovascular diseases, and smoker’s health might be compromised more than the average people. In this study, it aims to explore the use of fire alarm sensors for smoke detection and employ logistic regression and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) algorithms for the classification of smoke-related events. Logistic regression is done through dimensionality reduction while SVC is done through hyperparameter tuning of random search. The accuracy result of both logistic regression and support vector machine for the testing data, respectively 90% and 99.99%. The SVC with random search shows better results for all performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall than Logistic regression. Hence, the SVC is a more reliable modeling algorithm than Logistic Regression. These models provide a means to enhance early fire detection systems and enable timely response, contributing to improved safety and reduced fire-related risk.

In this project, has several targets to serve, which are:
1.	Study the effectiveness of smoke detectors to detect the existence of fire based on the surrounding air conditions.
2.	Find the best model to predict smoke detection based on the fire alarm sensor.
3.	Examine the better forecast to minimize the destruction caused by the fire damage.
